# Project Report: Line Following Robot

## Objective
To build a simple robot that can automatically follow a black line on a white surface using Arduino.

## Components
- Arduino Uno
- L298N Motor Driver
- 2 DC Motors + Wheels
- 2 IR Sensors
- Robot Chassis
- Battery Pack

## How It Works
- The IR sensors detect the contrast between black (line) and white (background).
- The Arduino processes the sensor signals and decides which motors to drive.
- If the left sensor detects black → robot turns left.
- If the right sensor detects black → robot turns right.
- If both sensors detect black → robot moves straight.

## Outcome
The robot successfully followed a black line drawn on a white surface, demonstrating basic robotics and automation concepts.

## Applications
- Automated warehouse robots
- Autonomous delivery systems
- Learning base for self-driving cars
