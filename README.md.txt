# Line Following Robot using Arduino

This project demonstrates a simple **line-following robot** built with Arduino, IR sensors, and DC motors.  
The robot can detect a black line on a white surface and follow it automatically.  

## Components Used
- Arduino Uno
- L298N Motor Driver
- 2 DC Motors + Wheels
- 2 IR Sensors
- Robot Chassis
- Battery Pack

## How It Works
- The IR sensors detect contrast between black (line) and white (surface).
- Arduino processes the signals and controls the motors.
- If the left sensor detects black → robot turns left.
- If the right sensor detects black → robot turns right.
- If both detect black → robot goes straight.

## Applications
- Smart factories (robots following floor lines for transport)
- Autonomous delivery bots
- Foundation for self-driving cars

## Demo
A short video/demo will be added soon.
